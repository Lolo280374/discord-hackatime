**Add Discord statistics within Hackatime!**
**Project made for the Summer of Making 25, at HackClub!**

</div>

## simple overview
This project is a simple Vencord plugin (I don't plan on making one for BetterDiscord, it's dead atp) allowing you to track your Discord statistics within Hackatime, for some reason I guess?
Built using TypeScript, to get a project idea for SOM 2025

</div>

## how can I install this
### Prerequisites
- Vencord from source (I won't be doing a tutorial for now)
- pnpm or npm or yarn (i'll be using pnpm)

### Installation
Once you have Vencord from source, make a "userplugins" folder within the "src" folder, add the plugin folder there (git clone it)
<br>then, run "pnpm build", and "pnpm inject", and hit enter if you use the default discord client, otherwise select yours.
<br>it's installed! you can now configure it from regular plugin settings.
